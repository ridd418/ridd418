# 👋 Hey, I’m Ridd

I build things by breaking them down into systems.

> TL;DR — Fundamentals-first JavaScript developer focused on modular systems, and building real instincts through refactoring and experimentation.

Right now that mostly means **modular JavaScript projects**, but the thing I’m actually obsessed with is **architecture** — how pieces talk to each other, how state flows, and how complexity stays contained instead of exploding.

I’m still early in the craft. I’m not pretending otherwise.

But I take fundamentals seriously, and I care a lot about _doing things cleanly_ — not perfectly, just intentionally.

---

## 🧠 How I got here (short version)

I didn’t start with “I want to be a web dev.”

I started trying to build a **SaaS product**, hit a wall relying on AI-generated code, and realized something uncomfortable:

> I couldn’t tell *why* things worked — only that they worked (until they didn’t).

That sucked.

So I reset. Went back to fundamentals. Learned programming properly.

Web dev just happened to be the **sandbox** where I applied those fundamentals.

Somewhere along the way, I realized I’ve always liked thinking in systems — not just in code, but in life, planning, finance, even random stuff like workflows and habits.

Code just made it explicit.

## 🔧 What I actually do

Right now, my focus is:

- **Vanilla JavaScript**, structured and modular
- Clear separation of concerns (engine vs UI vs state)
- ES Modules, import maps, minimal tooling
- Refactoring old projects to reflect what I *now* understand
- Writing docs that explain *why* things are built the way they are  
  _(okay, nobody likes docs — but it needs to be done, for the people who are going to read my code base, including me. That's reason enough!)_

I like code that:

- can be reasoned about
- doesn’t hide state behind magic
- doesn’t need a framework just to stay sane

I’m not anti-framework — just opinionated about understanding first.

## 📦 What to look at (start here)

If you landed here to judge my work, don’t scroll randomly.

Start with these (in order):

### Refactored Projects

1. **Rock Paper Scissors (mini game engine)** — [Repo](https://github.com/ridd418/rps-game)

   → Small but complete loop  
   → Focus: engine/UI separation, event delegation, state isolation

2. **Deal Timer (mini timer system)** — [Repo](https://github.com/ridd418/deal-timer)

   → Time-based state, persistence, restart safety  
   → Focus: mostly-pure timer logic + UI callbacks + localStorage

3. **Persona Matcher (quiz engine)** — [Repo](https://github.com/ridd418/persona-matcher)

   → Slightly more complex system  
   → Focus: decoupled quiz engine, scoring logic, immutability, callbacks as state emitters

Each repo has **Discussions** explaining:

- the core architecture
- what I refactored
- what I learned and what I’d do differently next time

If you care about *thinking*, not just output — read those.

---

### 🚧 Work in Progress

- **Breezium Dashboard** — [Repo](https://github.com/ridd418/breezium-dashboard) _(currently building)_  
  An opinionated productivity dashboard focused on reducing clutter and encouraging focus through simple psychological triggers.

  This is where I’m experimenting more openly and letting the architecture evolve in public instead of waiting for a “perfect” version.

---

## 🧪 How I work

I don’t like fake-perfect Git histories.

I experiment. I break things. I save broken states.

Then I stabilize, refactor, and only merge when something actually works.

That’s why you’ll see:

- snapshot branches
- feature branches with meaningful commits
- non-linear history (on purpose)

If you’re curious, check the **[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ridd418/breezium-dashboard/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)** in some repos — it explains the workflow clearly.

---

## 🚧 Where I’m at (honest status)

- I’m **new**, not “junior-by-title but senior-by-ego”
- I’m actively learning by building and refactoring
- I’m comfortable shipping early and refactoring in public instead of waiting for the “perfect” moment
- I don’t know everything — I *do* know how to reason, debug, and improve

I care more about:

- long-term understanding
- maintainable systems
- learning fast without burning out

than grinding myself into dust for a logo.

## 🤝 Why you might want to reach out

You might want to talk if:

- you like modular, framework-light architecture
- you care about fundamentals over hype
- you need small, well-defined frontend work
- you’re building something indie and want help thinking it through
- or you just want to talk systems and trade ideas

I’m open to **small freelance gigs**, collaborations, or just simple conversations involving real systems and thinking—not just execution.

## 📬 How to reach me

- **Twitter / X**: _[@ridd418](https://x.com/ridd418)_ — for private DMs
- **GitHub Discussions**: preferred for project-related thoughts

No LinkedIn. No corporate theater.

## 🧩 Final note

I don’t have everything figured out.

But I’m building, learning, refactoring, and documenting as honestly as I can — and I’m not stopping.

If this resonates, you’re probably in the right place.
